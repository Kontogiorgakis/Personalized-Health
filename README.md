# Personalized-Health

A comprehensive medical platform facilitating seamless appointment scheduling for patients and efficient appointment management for doctors.

## Overview

The project was executed within the framework of the HY359 course, incorporating a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java Servlets, and Rapid APIs. This multifaceted system operates as a dual-purpose platform, catering to both clients and administrators. The client interface facilitates the closure of appointments with medical professionals and the creation of comprehensive medical histories, while the administrative interface is designed to oversee and manage the scheduling process between doctors and clients.

Employing servlets, the system diligently maintains user data, ensuring that pertinent information remains accessible for medical practitioners to deliver tailored treatments and care.
